<h1>My approach</h1>

<p>Together, we slow down and explore the full landscape of your professional experience. Whether you are an associate finding your footing or a seasoned director navigating systemic change, our work is a reciprocal exchange of wisdom and strategy.</p>

<hr data-function="spacer">

<h2>A reciprocal partnership</h2>

<p>Mentorship is a co-created journey. I offer structure, and your voice shapes the work. We grow something together that neither of us could cultivate alone, and I often walk away gaining new understanding. Our conversations move fluidly between:</p>

<ul class="alt-indent">
<li><b>Micro</b>: emotion, intuition, countertransference, and patterns</li>
<li><b>Macro</b>: meaning, identity, cultural context, and direction</li>
</ul>

<hr data-function="spacer">

<h2>Praxis that lives in your work</h2>

<p>Insight is powerful, but integration creates change. Through small, intentional shifts, you&#8217;ll strengthen:</p>

<ul class="alt-indent">
<li>Boundaries</li>
<li>Presence and attunement</li>
<li>Clinical confidence</li>
<li>A rooted sense of self</li>
</ul>
<p>We fortify your identity and resilience, building a practice that can truly sustain you. Redefine what support can be.</p>
