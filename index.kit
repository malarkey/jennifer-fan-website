<p>I support clinicians who want to deepen their work, strengthen their professional identity, and cultivate the inner steadiness needed to sustain a meaningful clinical life.</p>

<p>Through relational mentorship, reflective assessment, and restorative consultation, I offer a space to return to yourself—your values, your instincts, your integrity—and create a professional path that feels both ethical and alive.</p>

<p>Whether you&#8217;re curious or committed, a conversation can help clarify your next step.</p>
