<h1>Holding space</h1>

<p>Session after session, whether you are absorbing grief, trauma, conflict, and complexity that most people never witness or holding the structural weight of an entire team, that burden doesn’t disappear when the hour or day ends. It follows you into your relationships, your rest, your body, and your sense of who you are.</p>

<hr data-function="spacer">

<h2>As clinicians, we&rsquo;re containers</h2>

<p>We hold emotion, create safety, and offer presence with a steadiness that often goes unnamed. Over time, that weight can pull us thin, blur our intuition, or disconnect us from the parts of practice that once felt grounding.</p>

<p>The strain doesn&rsquo;t stay neatly at work. We hold emotion, create safety, and offer presence with a steadiness that often goes unnamed. Over time, that weight can pull us thin, blur our intuition, or disconnect us from the parts of practice that once felt grounding.</p>

<p>Those cracks aren&rsquo;t failures. They&rsquo;re the natural result of extraordinary emotional labor carried quietly, consistently, and often alone.</p>

<p>I know this terrain intimately. I&rsquo;ve lived the overwhelm, the doubt, the stretching-too-thin; and I&rsquo;ve rebuilt from it. Clinical mentorship with me offers a grounded space to set some of that weight down, see yourself more clearly, and return to a way of practicing that feels rooted, sustainable, and fully yours.</p>

<p>The work is weighty. You don&rsquo;t have to carry it alone. Take 30 minutes just for you. Let&rsquo;s explore how to restore your strength, clarity, and balance.</p>
