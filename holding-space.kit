<h1>Holding space</h1>

<p>Session after session, whether you are absorbing grief, trauma, conflict, and complexity that most people never witness. Whether you are holding the room for a client or the structural weight of an entire team, that burden doesn&rsquo;t disappear when the hour or day ends. It follows you into your rest, your relationships, and the quietest parts of yourself.
</p>

<h2>As clinicians, we&rsquo;re containers</h2>

<p>We hold emotion, create safety, and offer presence with a steadiness that often goes unnamed. Over time, that weight can pull us thin, blur our intuition, or disconnect us from the parts of practice that once felt grounding.</p>

<p>The strain doesn&rsquo;t stay neatly at work. It begins to corrode your internal landscape—thinning your patience, clouding your clarity, and making rest feel like an elusive task rather than a restoration. Most clinicians push through the depletion longer than they should… until something quietly cracks.
</p>

<p>Those cracks aren&rsquo;t failures. They&rsquo;re the natural result of extraordinary emotional labor carried quietly, consistently, and often alone.
</p>

<p>I know this terrain intimately. I&rsquo;ve lived the overwhelm, the doubt, the stretching-too-thin; and I&rsquo;ve rebuilt from it. Clinical mentorship with me offers a grounded space to set some of that weight down, see yourself more clearly, and return to a way of practicing that feels rooted, sustainable, and fully yours.</p>

<p>The work is weighty. You don&rsquo;t have to carry it alone. Take 20 minutes just for you. Let&rsquo;s explore how to restore your strength, clarity, and balance.</p>
