<h1 data-size="3xl">Am I just playing games?</h1>

<p class="alt-lede">The question of &#8220;simply playing games&#8221; in session has emerged repeatedly in my conversations with clinicians. I&#8217;ve had many fruitful discussions about the actual, underlying purpose of bringing games into the therapeutic space. I wanted to consolidate some of those ideas and share them more broadly here, because it is time to put some of that self-doubt to rest.</p>

<p>I get it. Sometimes after an entire session of playing Uno or Jenga, you are left wondering, Did I actually do anything therapeutic? The answer is a resounding Yes, you did! You are not just a babysitter playing a game with a kid, you are a clinician. Those clinical skills don&#8217;t just go away because you&#8217;re not engaged in talk therapy. There is an intentionality that you bring to your &#8220;play.&#8221;</p>

<p>I get that you&#8217;re high achievers and want to implement all the things you&#8217;ve learned about in school. Please know that you are doing more than you&#8217;re giving yourself credit for, because intentionality is the engine of intervention.</p>

<p>Think about it: what are your favorite, most enduring memories from college? Where did you truly learn about yourself, your boundaries, and how to navigate the world? Was it sitting in a lecture hall? Or was it doing something with fun friends? Going to a football game? Partying? Taking a road trip and cramming way too many people into a single hotel room? Play, perhaps?</p>

<p>Kids learn through play because play hits us differently than conversations do. It engages the body, often bypassing language barriers, and leaves a more visceral, longer-lasting imprint. This is why children attend play-based preschools—that environment is the natural laboratory for learning about the self, other people, relationships, and the world. Doesn&#8217;t that sound exactly like the skills we are trying to help them build in therapy?

<h2>Considerations to play</h2>

<p>Is the game an intervention, or is it a vehicle to drive our conversation forward?</p>

<ul class="alt-indent">
<li>Am I simply observing behaviors or am I intervening?</li>
<li>Does a client feel more at ease to engage in talk therapy if there&#8217;s a game to focus on?</li>
<li>Do we break up the session to dedicate time to a game and to talk therapy, separately?</li>
<li>How might I tailor the game to be more therapeutic?</li>
</ul>

<p>Should I let my client win?</p>

<ul class="alt-indent">
<li>What is the reason for referral?</li>
<li>Are they used to winning?</li>
<li>Would it be better to start with a co-operative game, where you and the client work together to win the game?</li>
<li>Are they cheating to win?</li>
</ul>

<p>I get what you&#8217;re saying, but with one client, it really just feels like we&#8217;re playing games. Therapy typically starts light with rapport building and games, it tends to end in a similar fashion. If you find that you&#8217;re not getting much non/verbal content out of your sessions, it may be time to consider whether therapy is still appropriate. If games played a big part in your therapy, you may consider including &#8220;prescribed fun&#8221; like a family game night in your discharge plans.</p>
