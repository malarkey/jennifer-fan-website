<h1>Privacy</h1>

<p><b>Last updated</b> December 2025</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I respect the EU&rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and this policy explains how I collect and treat any information you give me. You won&rsquo;t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. I&rsquo;ve no desire to trick you into agreeing to something you might later regret.</p>

<h3 id="why-I-value-your-privacy">Why I value your privacy</h3>

<p>I value your privacy as much as I do my own, so I&rsquo;re committed to keeping your personal and business information safe. I ask for only the bare minimum from my clients. I&rsquo;ll never use your personal information for any reason other than why you gave it, and I&rsquo;ll never give anyone access to it unless I&rsquo;m forced to by law.</p>

<h3 id="how-I-collect-information">How I collect information</h3>

<p>I ask for contact information including your name, email address, and phone number, on my website so that I can reply to your inquiry.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t use cookies or scripts which are designed to track the websites you visit. I don&rsquo;t use analytics or native social media &lsquo;like&rsquo; or &lsquo;sharing&rsquo; buttons which also build profiles of your internet activity.</p>

<p>Occasionally, I might receive your contact information from one of my partners. If I do, I protect it in exactly the same way as if you give it to me directly.</p>

<h3 id="what-information-I-store">What information I store</h3>

<p>When you contact me by email or through our website, I store your name and email address, if you&rsquo;ve given them to me.</p>

<h3 id="how-I-me-your-information">How I use your information</h3>

<p>I occasionally use your contact information to send you details of my services. When I do, you have the option to unsubscribe from these communications and I won&rsquo;t send them to you again.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-responsible-for-your-information-at-our-company">Who&rsquo;s responsible for your information at my project</h3>

<p>I am responsible for the security of your information. You can contact me by email if you have concerns about the information I store.</p>

<h3 id="who-has-access-to-information-about-you">Who has access to information about you</h3>

<p>When I store information in my own systems, only the people who need it have access. My team has access to everything you&rsquo;ve provided, but individuals have access to only what they need to do their job.</p>

<h3 id="steps-I-take-to-keep-your-information-private">Steps I take to keep your information private</h3>

<p>Where I store your information in third-party services, I restrict access only to people who need it. I store passwords in an encrypted password manager, use a different, randomly generated password for each service, and never use the same password twice. The computers I use are all encrypted and protected by a passcode or fingerprint access. These computers ask for authentication whenever they&rsquo;re started or periods of inactivity. My mobile devices are also protected by a fingerprint or facial recognition.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-complain">How to complain</h3>

<p>I take complaints very seriously. If you&rsquo;ve any reason to complain about the ways I handle your privacy, please contact me by email.</p>

<h3 id="changes-to-the-policy">Changes to the policy</h3>

<p>If I change the contents of this policy, those changes will become effective the moment I publish them on my website.</p>

<p>My privacy policy is based on <a href="https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/killer-privacy">Killer Privacy</a>, the GDPR privacy policy template.</p>
