<h1>Meet Jennifer</h1>

<p>I bring together clinical practice, leadership, and teaching to create mentorship that is reflective, trauma-informed, values-driven, and responsive to both your inner world and everyday clinical realities.</p>
<h2>Why I Mentor</h2>
<p>Throughout my career, I saw brilliant clinicians fracture—not from a lack of skill, but from a lack of space. They had supervisors for their cases and therapists for their trauma, but nowhere to process the unique weight of their professional humanity. I built my mentorship practice to fill that
gap.</p>

<h3>Clinical breadth across the continuum of care</h3>

<p>Experience across inpatient psychiatry, substance use treatment, hospice, wraparound services, community mental health programs, school-based services, private practice, and LGBTQIA+ affirming care has shown me the emotional and systemic landscapes clinicians move through. I understand the strain, the strength, and the places where growth quietly begins.</p>

<h3>Leadership and systems insight</h3>

<h3>Lifelong educator and scholar</h3>
