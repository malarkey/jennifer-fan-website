<h1>Beyond supervision</h1>

<p>Clinical supervision is essential, but it was never designed to hold everything.</p>

<p>For the Associate, supervision focuses on case management and compliance. It is necessary for licensure, but because it is rooted in hierarchy,
vulnerability often carries an edge of performance.</p>

<p>For the Licensed Professional, a new chapter begins. The formal structures of supervision often taper off just as the weight of your role increases. You become the “Expert” or “Anchor” for others—a transition that deserves its own support as you navigate the responsibility of being the final authority.</p>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re working toward your license or you&rsquo;ve been leading for decades, the deeper layers of your clinical life still need a home.
</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what mentorship holds—the parts of you that supervision can&rsquo;t quite reach.</p>

<ul class="alt-indent">
<li>Your Identity: Developing who you are beyond the labels</li>
<li>Your Emotional Labor: Processing the cumulative weight you carry</li>
<li>The Unspoken: Exploring countertransference and the doubts that arise in silence</li>
<li>The Somatic: Understanding how your body holds this work</li>
<li>Your Self: Navigating how this career continuously reshapes you</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, I meet you as a whole person—your mind, emotions, values, and lived experience. Our relationship serves as the connective tissue between your
professional skill and your personal heart, providing the space for a center that holds.
</p>


<p>Our relationship is flexible, collaborative, and deeply human.</p>

<ul class="alt-indent">
<li>Free from evaluation, performance metrics, or oversight</li>
<li>Detached from licensure strings and administrative reporting</li>
<li>Centered on true presence without an alternate agenda</li>
</ul>

<p>Just presence, curiosity, and shared understanding. Reaching for mentorship isn&rsquo;t a sign of struggle—it&rsquo;s a sign of intention.</p>
