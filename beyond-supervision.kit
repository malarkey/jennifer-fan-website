<h1>Beyond supervision</h1>

<p>Clinical supervision is essential—but I&rsquo;ve learned it has limits.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re an associate, supervision often focuses on case management, compliance, and clinical safety. You need it for licensure, but because it&rsquo;ls rooted in hierarchy and evaluation, being truly vulnerable can feel risky.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re already licensed, you face a different challenge. The support of clinical supervision typically disappears once you earn your license. Suddenly, you&rsquo;re expected to be the expert and the anchor for others—often with nowhere to process the weight of that responsibility yourself.</p>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re working toward your license or you&rsquo;ve been leading for decades, the deeper layers of your clinical life still need a home.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;ls what mentorship holds—the parts of you that supervision can&rsquo;t quite reach.</p>

<ul class="alt-">
<li>Your Identity: Developing who you are beyond the labels.</li>
<li>Your Emotional Labor: Processing the cumulative weight you carry.</li>
<li>The Unspoken: Exploring countertransference and the doubts that arise in silence.</li>
<li>The Somatic: Understanding how your body holds this work.</li>
<li>Your Self: Navigating how this career continuously reshapes you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mentorship creates a dedicated safe space—a necessary middle ground that clinical supervision and personal therapy often miss.</p>

<p>I meet you as a whole person—your mind, emotions, values, and lived experience—to help you restore clarity, steadiness, and self-compassion.</p>

<p>Our relationship is flexible, collaborative, and deeply human.</p>

<ul class="alt-">
<li>Free from evaluation, performance metrics, or oversight.</li>
<li>Detached from licensure strings and administrative reporting.</li>
<li>Centered on true presence without an alternate agenda.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just presence, curiosity, and shared understanding. Reaching for mentorship isn&rsquo;t a sign of struggle—it&rsquo;s a sign of intention.</p>
