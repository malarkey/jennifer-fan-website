<h1>Privacy</h1>

<p><b>Last updated</b> December 2025</p>
<h2>A Note on Professional Containment</h2>

<p>In our work together, we often talk about the importance of containment—creating a secure frame where deep work can happen safely. This page is the containment for our business relationship.</p>

<p>While the legal details below are necessary to protect the structure of my practice, my commitment to you is simple: Stewardship. Whether it is your data, your financial investment, or your professional vulnerability; I treat it with the same care and ethical rigor that I bring to the clinical space.</p>

<p>These policies exist not to create distance, but to create clarity. When we are clear about the boundaries of our work—from refunds to privacy—we are free to focus entirely on your growth.</p>

<p>Warmly,</p>

<p>Dr. Jennifer Fan<br>
<i>Founder, Insightful Praxis LLC</i></p>

<h2>Integrity in Practice: Transparency & Terms</h2>

<h3>Scope &#38; Responsibility</h3>

<p><b>Educational Purpose & Scope</b>: This website is an informational space designed to share resources and describe my mentorship services. Please note that browsing this site or reaching out via the contact form does not establish a professional relationship; that formal partnership begins only when we have both signed a dedicated service agreement. To that end, the materials and services I provide through Insightful Praxis LLC are strictly for educational purposes and professional development. They are not a substitute for professional clinical judgment, clinical supervision, legal advice, or therapeutic intervention.</p>

<p><b>Outcomes & Guarantees</b>: While these services are designed to promote deep growth and professional insight, I do not imply or guarantee specific outcomes, qualifications, or professional advancement. Your results depend on your unique circumstances, licensure, and commitment to the process.</p>

<p><b>Professional Responsibility</b>: You are responsible for applying all insights in accordance with your own licensure, professional scope, and governing ethical standards.</p>

<p><b>Insurance</b>: Insightful Praxis LLC maintains professional liability insurance appropriate for the educational and consultative nature of my work.</p>


<h3>Testimonial Disclaimer & Integrity</h3>

<p>Testimonials on this site represent individual experiences and honest opinions. They do not guarantee similar outcomes. I do not provide compensation, gifts, or incentives in exchange for these statements.</p>

<h3>Business Identity & Doing Business As (DBA)</h3>

<p>Insightful Praxis LLC operates two distinct brands.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Dr. Jennifer Fan: The registered DBA name for the bespoke, mentorship services I provide personally.</li>
	<li>Insightful Praxis: A training platform focused on systematic professional education.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: All contracts, payments, and legal liabilities are held under the parent company, Insightful Praxis LLC.</p>

<h3>Privacy & Data Stewardship</h3>

<p><b>Data Usage: I use personal information collected solely for administrative and educational purposes.</p>

<p><b>HIPAA Standards</b>: While I act as an educational consultant and not a healthcare provider, I voluntarily maintain Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) level confidentiality standards. I view your professional data with the same stewardship as I would a clinical record.</p>

<p><b>Digital Risk</b>: While I use industry-standard security (including SSL encryption), absolute confidentiality cannot be guaranteed for information shared across the open internet.</p>


<h3>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h3>

<p><b>Mentorship</b>: These programs represent a commitment to the full duration of the agreement. Payments are non-refundable, and mentees remain responsible for the full balance of agreed-upon fees.</p>

<p><b>Scheduling</b>: Because your time is held exclusively for you, 48 hours’ notice is required to reschedule. Late cancellations incur a fee (50% for the first occurrence; 100% thereafter).</p>


<h3>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) & Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)</h3>
<p>&ldquo;<b>Do Not Sell or Share</b>&rdquo;: I do not sell, share, or otherwise disclose personal information. This website does not use tracking analytics or cookies, and no personal information about site visitors is collected.</p>

<p><b>Your Rights</b>: Because no personal information is collected or shared, there is nothing to opt out of. If you have questions, you may contact me directly for clarification.</p>

<h3>Intellectual Property & AI Usage</h3>
<p><b>Copyright</b>: © 2025 Insightful Praxis LLC. All rights reserved. Materials are for personal professional development only. Reproduction or commercial distribution is prohibited.</p>

<p><b>AI Disclosure</b>: I use artificial intelligence (AI) tools solely to assist with document organization and formatting. Every clinical insight and educational concept is born from my own practice and research—personally developed and reviewed by me to ensure it meets my standards for your growth.</p>

<h3>Accessibility Statement</h3>
<p><b>Commitment</b>: I am committed to ensuring digital accessibility and strive to conform to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards.</p>

<p><b>Feedback</b>: If you find any part of this site difficult to use or navigate, please reach out to <a href="mailto:jennifer@insightfulpraxis.com">jennifer@insightfulpraxis.com</a>. I want this space to be accessible to all, and I am happy to provide alternative formats or accommodations to ensure you have what you need.</p>
