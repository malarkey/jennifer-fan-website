<p>My brain hasn&rsquo;t always made sense (and to this day sometimes it still doesn&rsquo;t) but meeting and working with Jennifer has been a magical experience for me. With her knowledge, guidance, and support I&rsquo;ve been able to achieve visible growth and development in my skills as a clinician. She&rsquo;s able to give feedback in a way that is constructive, real, and has the well being of both my clients and myself in mind. She&rsquo;s made me feel truly ‘seen&rsquo; both as a clinician and as a person, reducing feelings of Imposter Syndrome that can often steal joy from the process of learning. Her confidence in me has encouraged me to step into actions that were previously intimidating but necessary for career development. The energy and ideas that seemed trapt within me are finding their way into the world with Jennifer&rsquo;s mentorship.</p>

<p>The only downside to becoming fully licensed is no longer having the option to have
Jennifer Fan as your supervisor. As an AMFT, I&rsquo;ve had the privilege (and extreme luck)
of having Jennifer as both my individual and group supervisor, and later as my mentor –
I just can&rsquo;t let her go! - and I can honestly say that she rocks/is amazing in every way.
Jennifer Fan just gets it. Highly knowledgeable in the field, insightful, creative, kind,
humble, patient, supportive, honest, empathetic, and unwaveringly dedicated to her
supervisees and mentees — Jennifer Fan is honestly everything one could possibly wish
for in a supervisor. Jennifer challenges you to think outside the box, keeps you
grounded, motivates you to do better as a clinician, and will fearlessly have your back if
it&rsquo;s the right thing to do – even if it means putting herself on the line to do so as Jennifer
has repeatedly proven that she prioritizes truth and fairness over her own self-interest.
She is truly one in a million and an outlier in every positive way, and I hope to continue
learning from her for many years to come – or better yet, for the remainder of my career.
